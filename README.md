Kid gift management API - evolving from a simple CRUD to an advanced Spring Boot architecture with asynchronous processing, strategic blocking and modern design patterns

# üéÅ Gift Management API

> **From Simple CRUD to Enterprise Architecture** - A demonstration of modern Spring Boot development practices and architectural evolution

## üìã Project Overview

This project showcases the transformation of a simple gift management system into an enterprise-grade application, demonstrating advanced software engineering principles and architectural patterns.

**Original Goal**: Record gifts for kids with basic CRUD operations  
**Current State**: Full-featured enterprise API with advanced concurrency control, async processing, and modern design patterns

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Gift Management**: Complete CRUD operations for gift records
- **Kid Management**: Advanced kid creation with strategy pattern implementation
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch processing for large datasets
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive request validation and integrity checks

### Enterprise Features
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for improved performance
- **Strategic Locking**: Both optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control
- **Database Migrations**: Liquibase for schema versioning
- **Object Mapping**: MapStruct for efficient DTO-Entity conversion
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database resource management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Flexible runtime strategy selection
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulated request handling
- **AOP**: Cross-cutting concern management

### Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot 3.5.3**: Core framework
- **Spring Data JPA**: ORM and database interactions
- **Spring JDBC**: High-performance bulk operations
- **Spring Async**: Background task processing
- **Spring AOP**: Aspect-oriented programming
